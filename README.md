Running The Page
	-Open index.html in a new browser tab or window

Main Portfolio page
	- Inlined CSS to remove render blocking
	- Async'd the JavaScript as they weren't required to render and it removed the render blocking
	- Shrunk the profile pic and the pizza pic using PhotoShop to bring them down in size to an acceptable level
	- Removed the font link, as it was not changing the rendered page
	
Pizza page
	- Pulled out the class from the pizzaSize function for loop and the document prototype from the updatePositions function for loop and placed them in separate variables as they did not need to be run on every iteration through the loop
	- Moved the items variable out of the updatePositions for loop into the function scope as it did not need to be calculated on every iteration
	- Lowered the number of pizzas that are painted in the function from 200 to 75, as 200 seemed to be more than was needed
	-Pulled the items variable out of the updateposition function as it did not need to be created each time the function was called
	-Assigned the value of items.length to a seperate variable outside the function, as it did not need to be run each time the function was called
	-Changed the style.left to style.transform and used the translateX value to move the pizzas along the x-axis
	-Used the style.left in DOMcontentloaded function to establish the initial position of the pizzas so they would move correctly

## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
